      <p>Location: Ratnagiri.</p>
      <p>Ganpatipule is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful destinations in Konkan. It is about 25 km away from Ratnagiri city. The Ganpati idol here is self-manifested more than a thousand years ago. Ganpatipule is one of the 8 Ganpati temples (Ashta Ganpati Mandire) in India. The unusual thing to note here is that the Ganpati idol faces west (Pashchim Dwar Devata). Generally, the idols in other temples face east.

        Ganpatipule has a white sand beach just in front of it. It is one of the only two white sand beaches in Maharashtra. Further, you would not want to miss the Ambapoli and Phanaspoli (rotis made of Mango and Jackfruit).</p>

      <h2>AARE WARE BEACH</h2>

    <p>Location: Ratnagiri.</p>
      <p>Aare-Ware beach is around 15 km away from Ratnagiri and 12 km from Ganpatipule. Aare and Ware are twin beaches. The names are mentioned together as they are two sides of the same mountain. This beach is unique in itself.

        If you’re going to ride till here, the hill view is going to be mesmerising. The span of the sea is huge and all you can see is the water everywhere. It is soothing as the beach is tidy and far away from industrial waste. One important thing to be noted, especially for a traveller, is that the beach doesn’t have food stalls or eateries. You need to carry food items with you. A beach nearest to the town and yet peaceful? This is it!</p>

      <p>Location: Malvan taluka in Sindhudurg district.</p>
        <p>Tarkarli is famous for its long and narrow stretch of beach, with its pristine water, white sand, and of course Singhudurg, Maharashtra's popular sea fort.

            Tarkarli with a series of pristine beaches made up of white sand makes it an ideal choice for a holiday weekend. If lucky enough, you might spot Dolphins too. Tarkarli boasts of the finest talcum-powder sand to be found along Konkan. It could be called the most beautiful beach in all of Maharashtra, if not in India. As this place is just being discovered, you might be in time to find it untarnished by commercialization. The pristine white beaches shrouded with suru trees are a perfect place to relax, get in touch with nature and eat amazing Malvani food. The choice ranges from a long stroll along pristine white sand beaches to revisiting the past glory of Maratha bastion and forts.</p>

      <p>Location: Sindhudurg.</p>
        <p>Sindhudurg district is the southern part of the Konkan coast which is historically known for its long coast line and safe harbors. Sindhudurg district was earlier a part of Ratnagiri district. For administrative convenience and industrial and agricultural development, Ratnagiri district was divided into Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg with effect from 1 May 1981. Sindhudurg district now comprises the eight tahsils of Sawantwadi, Kudal, Vengurla, Malvan, Devgad, Kankavli, Vaibhavwadi and Dodamarg.</p>
